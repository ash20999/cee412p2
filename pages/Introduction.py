        ## Why Rear-End Collisions?
        Rear-end collisions are among the most common types of highway accidents.
        Analyzing their causes—road conditions, traffic volumes, driver demographics, and more—
        can help inform better safety interventions and design improvements.
        
        **Our Goal**:
        - Investigate factors contributing to collision frequency and severity
        - Provide data-driven recommendations for reducing rear-end collisions
